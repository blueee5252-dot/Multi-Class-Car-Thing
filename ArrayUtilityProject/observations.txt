When the debugger was on line 17 and the num was 1, pressing f10 made a yellow highlight to skip Line 18 and jump to the end of the loop.

When I pressed F10 at the end of the if statement, the yellow highlight jumped back up to the for loop line (line 16)

Once num became an even number, the yellow highlight went to the math line. I saw the Variables pane and saw sum was 0. After I pressed F10 one more time, the sum changed to 2
